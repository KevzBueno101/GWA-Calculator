📘 GWA Calculator

A clean, functional, and user-friendly GWA (General Weighted Average) Calculator built with Python and CustomTkinter, now distributed with a professional Windows installer (Inno Setup).

✨ A small project turned into a polished desktop app — built with Python, CustomTkinter, and enhanced using ChatGPT + GitHub Copilot.

🎯 Purpose

I created this application to easily compute my General Weighted Average (GWA) after receiving my class cards.
Instead of calculating everything manually, I built a simple and intuitive desktop tool to automate the process.
